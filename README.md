Fuzzy Memory Javascript Assignment

This was made for an assignment as part of a Javascript course at YRGO Gothenburg

The assignment:

- Create a memory game with 8-10 pairs
- The cards should be positioned randomly before a new game start
- The game must include a restart button that reorder the cards randomly, using Javascript and not through a page reload
- The game should be programmed in HTML, CSS and Javascript, no libraries or other languages are allowed

How to use:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your computer with this link https://github.com/HenrikBielsten/memory.git
2. For best experience, head to the directory called "fonts" and install the font called 'chalkIt.ttf'.
3. Open your browser and double click the index.html file to run it in your browser.
4. If it does not open in your browser: right-click on the file and open with-> "your browser".
5. Follow instructions on screen.
6. Win the game, because you are awesome!

Enjoy!
